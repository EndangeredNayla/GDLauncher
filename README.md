## üéÆ What is GDLauncher

GDLauncher Classic is a fork of the classic version of GDLauncher (before it went closed source). If you aren't aware, GDLauncher is a custom open-source Minecraft launcher written from the ground up in electron/react. Its main goal is to make it easy and enjoyable to manage different Minecraft versions and install `forge/fabric`, bringing the playing and modding experience to the next level!

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Comparison with CurseForge

This is an example of the time that GDLauncher Classic takes to install a modpack in comparison to CurseForge. Both tests are running at the same time over a 1Gbps network to ensure that the network doesn't impact the comparison.

- GDLauncher: `52s`
- Twitch Launcher: `145s`

## üìú History

This project started as a way for me to learn programming and get better at it. I initially developed it in C#.

After a while, I didn't really like the language, so I just started it again from scratch in React and Electron.
It was here that a community started gathering around the project. In the meanwhile, I also found a job where I could learn even more about best practices, data structures, and more.

This is why I decided to rewrite it completely one more time, applying all the knowledge I gained at that time, and that made it possible to implement a lot of really cool features, that were really complicated to code from a technical point of view.

Here you can find the previous versions of the code:

- [Original C# Code](https://www.github.com/gorilla-devs/GDLauncher/tree/csharp_legacy_launcher)
- [First React Version](https://www.github.com/gorilla-devs/GDLauncher/tree/GDLauncher_old)

## üéì License

This project is licensed under the GNU GPL V3.0 - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

If you need GDLauncher licensed under different conditions, please contact davide@gdevs.io

You are free to clone the repository and do whatever you want as long as you stick to the license above, just be aware that most of the assets available in the repository are licensed differently (check [COPYING.md](COPYING.md)) so you are not allowed to redistribute those. Also keep in mind that some features will not be working unless you set them up yourself (such as analytics, error tracking..) because the private API keys are stored secretly.

We do not encourage clones of this project (to avoid fragmentation) so don't expect any help from us when trying to do that. We, however, encourage collaboration and growth on this official project and you're more than welcome to contribute.
